# Spring-autobinding-vulnerability
This project aims to demonstrate a possible vulnerability for beginners in Spring Framework when using the autobinding and sessions

## What it is?
Eclipse framework automatically binds HTTP request parameters into objects 
in fact several other frameworks do this, what is commonly called autobinding or 
Mass Assignment. However what many forget is what happens if an attacker injects 
something into the requests.

## Goal
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate these attacks using sessions.
